# Project Notes & Learnings

## Project Overview

This is a custom CSS framework inspired by Automatic.css (ACSS) principles, built as a standalone implementation without requiring the WordPress plugin. The framework focuses on consistency, mathematical precision, and variable-first architecture.

## Key Learnings & Insights

### 1. Content-Grid System Implementation
- **Challenge**: The content-grid system wasn't initially included in the framework CSS
- **Solution**: Implemented based on ACSS plugin source code analysis
- **Key Discovery**: Content-grid uses 7 named grid columns with specific sizing:
  - `--gutter: 2.4rem` (flexible gutters)
  - `--content-width: min(65ch, 100% - var(--gutter) * 2)` (readable content width)
  - `--feature-width: 50px` (feature breakout areas)
  - `--feature-max-width: 100px` (maximum feature areas)

### 2. Grid Template Structure
```css
grid-template-columns: 
    [full-start] var(--full)
    [feature-max-start] minmax(0, var(--feature-max-width))
    [feature-start] minmax(0, var(--feature-width))
    [content-start] var(--content-width)
    [content-end] minmax(0, var(--feature-width))
    [feature-end] minmax(0, var(--feature-max-width))
    [feature-max-end] var(--full)
    [full-end];
```

### 3. Visual Demonstrations Work Best
- Interactive style guide with live examples proves most valuable for understanding
- 12-column background visualization helps users understand grid relationships
- Color-coded examples make different content widths immediately apparent

## Architectural Decisions

### File Organization
- Moved assets to dedicated `assets/` folder for better organization
- Maintained examples in `examples/` directory
- Documentation split between README.md and GETTING-STARTED.md

### Attribution Strategy
- Prominent attribution to Kevin Geary and Automatic.css team throughout documentation
- Clear indication this is inspired by, not affiliated with, the original ACSS
- Maintained respect for original methodology while creating standalone implementation

## Development Recommendations

### 1. Framework Structure
- **Priority**: Implement full content-grid system in main CSS files
- **Suggestion**: Create modular SCSS structure similar to ACSS:
  ```
  src/
  ├── config/           # Framework configuration
  ├── foundation/       # Core functions, mixins, variables  
  ├── systems/          # Color, typography, spacing systems
  ├── utilities/        # Utility classes
  └── patterns/         # Component patterns
  ```

### 2. Build System
- Consider implementing SCSS compilation for better maintainability
- Add CSS minification for production builds
- Create separate builds for different use cases (utilities-only, full framework, etc.)

### 3. Content-Grid Enhancements
- Add responsive behavior for mobile devices
- Implement container queries where supported
- Create utility classes for easier content-grid adoption

### 4. Documentation Strategy
- Interactive examples are crucial for adoption
- Consider creating a separate documentation site
- Add more real-world usage examples

## Technical Insights

### ACSS Plugin Analysis
From analyzing the automaticcss-plugin directory:
- Content-grid is highly sophisticated with dashboard configuration options
- Uses CSS custom properties extensively for dynamic behavior
- Implements careful conflict resolution with existing padding utilities
- Provides granular control over feature widths via dashboard

### Variable Naming Conventions
- Double-dash syntax (`.text--xl`, `.padding--m`) maintains consistency
- T-shirt sizing (xs, s, m, l, xl, xxl) across all utilities
- Mathematical relationships preserve visual harmony

## Future Considerations

### Naming the Project
Suggested names based on core characteristics:
- **Systematic CSS** - Emphasizes the methodical approach
- **Variable CSS** / **VarCSS** - Highlights variable-first architecture  
- **Framework Zero** - Zero dependencies, starting from scratch
- **Precision CSS** - Mathematical precision focus

### Potential Extensions
1. **WordPress Integration Guide** - How to use without the plugin
2. **React/Vue Component Library** - Styled components using the framework
3. **Figma/Design Tool Integration** - Design tokens export
4. **Advanced Grid Patterns** - Beyond basic content-grid

### Performance Considerations
- Framework appears lightweight and efficient
- CSS custom properties provide excellent browser support
- Minimal JavaScript requirements (only for interactive demos)

## Success Metrics

The framework successfully demonstrates:
- ✅ ACSS principles without WordPress dependency
- ✅ Working content-grid implementation
- ✅ Interactive style guide for learning
- ✅ Proper attribution and respect for original work
- ✅ Mathematical spacing relationships
- ✅ T-shirt sizing consistency

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Implement content-grid in main framework CSS files
2. **Short-term**: Create modular SCSS architecture
3. **Medium-term**: Build compilation system and multiple output formats
4. **Long-term**: Consider community feedback and potential extensions
